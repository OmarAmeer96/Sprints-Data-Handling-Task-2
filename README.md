# Employee Data Handling Task 1

This project is a Flutter application that fetches employee data from a remote API, caches it locally using `SharedPreferences`, and displays it in a visually appealing list. The app also includes a shimmer effect for loading states and a pull-to-refresh feature to fetch updated data from the server.

- **Local Caching**: Uses `SharedPreferences` to cache employee data locally for offline access.
- **Shimmer Effect**: Displays a shimmer loading effect while fetching data.
- **Pull-to-Refresh**: Allows users to refresh the employee list by pulling down.
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles errors and displays cached data if available.
- **Responsive UI**: Built with a responsive and visually appealing UI using gradients and custom widgets.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK installed on your machine.
- A code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Android Studio).

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OmarAmeer96/Sprints-Data-Handling-Task-2.git
   cd Sprints-Data-Handling-Task-1
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Run the App**:

   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## Usage

1. **Fetching Data**:

   - The app fetches employee data from the API when launched.
   - If the API call fails, it falls back to cached data (if available).

2. **Pull-to-Refresh**:

   - Pull down on the employee list to refresh the data from the server.

3. **Error Handling**:

   - If both the API call and cached data fail, an error message is displayed.

4. **Employee Details View**:

   - Tap on an employee card to view detailed information about the employee, including their name, age, salary and profile image.

   - The details view features a modern design with gradients, glassmorphism effects, and smooth animations.
